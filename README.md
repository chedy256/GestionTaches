# Task Management API

This API allows you to manage your personal tasks and to-do items. Think of it like a digital to-do list where you can create, update, complete, and organize your tasks.

The API is available at `http://localhost:8080`

## How It Works

This is a **personal task manager**. Each user has their own private task list - you can only see and manage your own tasks, not other people's tasks. You need to be logged in (authenticated) to use most features.

## What You Need to Know

- **Authentication Required**: You need a valid token (like a digital key) to access your tasks
- **JSON Format**: All data is sent and received in JSON format
- **Your Tasks Only**: You can only see/modify tasks that belong to you
- **Automatic Features**: Some tasks get archived automatically when completed and overdue
